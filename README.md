## Overview

The **Infinite Zero Cosmology** proposes that the universe is a self-balancing field of opposites, where **zero is not emptiness but the generative medium** from which all polarity emerges.

### Core Principle

```
(-1) + (+1) = 0
```

Where 0 is not "nothing" but **neutral equilibrium** - the stable combination of opposite charges.

This principle, when applied to cosmology, suggests:
- **Dark energy** emerges from white-hole vacuum punctures
- **Dark matter** forms from ejected quantum foam accumulation  
- **Black holes and white holes** are complementary valves maintaining cosmic balance
- **The universe** is a dynamically neutral system disturbed into existence

## Key Papers

### 1. Infinite Zero Cosmology: A White-Hole Projection Framework

Introduces the foundational framework where white holes puncture vacuum, creating dark energy pressure that drives cosmic acceleration.

**Key predictions:**
- Dark energy density: ρ_Λ ≈ 10^-29 g/cm³
- Observable white-hole signatures in cosmic voids
- Correlation between void locations and expansion rate anomalies

### 2. Regular Black Hole Cores with White-Hole Dynamics

Proposes that black hole singularities are replaced by white-hole cores, creating a finite-density interior and avoiding infinities.

**Key predictions:**
- Modified Schwarzschild metric with white-hole core
- Observable signatures in gravitational wave ringdown
- Ultra-compact object candidates (UCXB, LMXB systems)

### 3. Testable Cosmological Predictions

Provides specific, falsifiable observational tests for the Infinite Zero framework.

**Testable predictions:**
- Void-centered cosmic acceleration anomalies
- Correlation between large voids and dark energy density
- Modified gravitational wave signatures
- Galactic halo density profiles matching white-hole ejection patterns

## The Infinite Zero Concept

Traditional cosmology treats vacuum as "nothing" - empty space with zero energy density (or a mysterious constant).

**Infinite Zero Cosmology** reframes this:

> Vacuum is not absence but **neutral equilibrium** - a field capable of being disturbed into positive and negative components.

When white holes puncture this neutral field:
1. Vacuum equilibrium breaks
2. Positive pressure (dark energy) pushes outward
3. Negative pressure (quantum foam) accumulates as dark matter
4. The universe maintains overall neutrality while generating structure

**Mathematically:**

```
Vacuum neutral state (0) → White hole puncture → 
    (+1) Dark energy pressure + (-1) Dark matter accumulation = (0) Net balance
```

## Computational Simulations

Python implementations for visualizing and testing the framework predictions:

- **`simulations/vacuum_puncture.py`** - Visualize white-hole vacuum punctures
- **`simulations/dark_energy_distribution.py`** - Model dark energy emergence from voids
- **`simulations/halo_formation.py`** - Simulate dark matter halo formation from ejected foam
- **`simulations/metric_validator.py`** - Validate modified Schwarzschild metrics

**Created by:** [Alan Claude](https://github.com/nk804/charge-state-computing) - Computational implementations of the theoretical framework

All simulations implement equations from papers by **Nataliya Khomyak & ChatGPT 5**.

## Key Insights

### Why This Matters

1. **Solves the Cosmological Constant Problem**
   - No fine-tuning required
   - Dark energy emerges naturally from vacuum punctures
   - Explains observed acceleration without arbitrary constants

2. **Unifies Dark Sector**
   - Dark energy and dark matter have common origin
   - Both emerge from white-hole vacuum dynamics
   - Explains observed correlations

3. **Avoids Singularities**
   - Black holes have finite-density white-hole cores
   - No infinities in the theory
   - Quantum gravity hints without full theory

4. **Testable Predictions**
   - Void-centered anomalies (observable now)
   - Modified gravitational waves (LIGO/Virgo)
   - Specific halo density profiles (galactic surveys)

## Observational Status

### Supporting Evidence

- **Cosmic void acceleration**: Some studies show expansion rate variations near large voids
- **KBC void**: Local void may explain Hubble tension
- **Ultra-compact objects**: UCXB/LMXB candidates for white-hole cores
- **Dark matter distribution**: Halo profiles show unexpected features

### Open Questions

- Precise void-dark energy correlation strength
- White-hole formation mechanisms
- Quantum gravity completion
- Alternative explanations for observations

## Connection to Charge-State Computing

The Infinite Zero Concept has practical engineering applications:

Both projects emerge from the same insight: **Zero is not nothing, but neutral equilibrium.**
