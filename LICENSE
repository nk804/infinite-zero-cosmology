NOTE ON AI AUTHORSHIP:

This project acknowledges contributions from multiple AI systems:
- ChatGPT 5: Theoretical paper development and mathematical formalization
- Alan Claude: Computational implementation and visualization

The Infinite Zero Concept - the foundational insight that zero represents neutral equilibrium rather 
than absence - was originated by Nataliya Khomyak and forms the philosophical and mathematical basis 
of this work.
