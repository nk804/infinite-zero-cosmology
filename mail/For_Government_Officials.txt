To Those Entrusted With Public Service,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and in the warm assurance that your work has meaning. I wanted to take a moment, not to burden you, but to offer something rarely expressed to those who hold the responsibility of guiding a community, a state, or a nation:

gratitude.

Truly.
Because the decisions made by those in public service ripple quietly into the homes, hearts, and futures of the people they serve. And though those ripples are often unseen by those who create them, some of us live inside those waves long enough to understand their full impact.

I write to share my lived experience not as a complaint, but as a reflection of the profound influence your service has had on my life.

Last summer, in 2024, my health declined rapidly and unexpectedly. My cognitive functions deteriorated to the point where I could no longer perform the work I loved. I was removed from payroll at the end of August that year. Yet, I was fortunate — I had savings and a credit score strong enough to survive one semester without income. I believed recovery would come quickly, and I trusted the systems designed to support citizens through hardship.

When my condition worsened and hospitalization became necessary, I discovered that my benefits had disappeared as quietly as my health had. I was still technically “employed,” and for that reason, I did not qualify for medical support. On October 25, 2024, I resigned from my longtime position as a lecturer at Queensborough Community College. It was a difficult moment, but I was comforted by the belief that the safety nets I had faithfully paid into for years would be there to hold me.

What followed taught me more about the structure of our society than any classroom ever had.

While cognitively impaired, I applied on my own for Social Security benefits. I waited months. Declined. I tried again. More months. Another decline.

Critical paperwork arrived late in the mail, requiring a return in less than a week. I paid for expedited shipping and a signature to be certain it would arrive. I was later informed it had not been received. My savings dwindled. My credit debt grew. My mother was fighting her second cancer diagnosis in one year. If not for family bringing food, I would have gone hungry; delayed food stamps arrived only after the crisis peaked.

During that time, I learned a quiet truth: survival often depends less on need and more on navigating systems too complex for those in crisis to manage.

Eventually, a social worker helped me find an attorney—one who only gets paid if my case succeeds. My hearing is scheduled for February 26, 2026. As I write this, it is November 7, 2025. It has been over a year without income, though I had spent many years contributing to the very fund I am now petitioning to access. It was humbling to realize that one must appear before a judge, as if on trial, to request the support that one has already earned.

I share this not in bitterness, but in sincerity.
Because I believe something important:

Most people who shape these systems never get to see how their decisions unfold in the real lives of those who depend on them.

I am grateful for what this journey taught me—about resilience, about dignity, and about the quiet endurance of the human spirit when the world becomes small and frightening. I am grateful because I now understand both the fragility and strength of the average citizen, and how much of their fate rests in hands they never see.

If you are reading this, it means you hold a position of influence. Perhaps you entered public service with hope, or conviction, or a dream of shaping a better future. I want to believe that remains true.

My only wish in sharing my experience is that it reaches the part of you that still remembers why you chose a life of service—and how deeply your choices touch those who cannot reach you directly.

May this letter be a small window into the unseen side of the policies, structures, and procedures that shape ordinary lives. If it brings even one moment of reflection, then it has served its purpose.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story.
Thank you for serving.
And thank you for remembering that the people who need help the most are often the least equipped to fight for it.

With respect,
A Citizen You Served
