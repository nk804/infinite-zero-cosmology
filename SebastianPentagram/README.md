# Sebastian Pentagram — Research Hub  
### Independent AI Research Track within the Infinite Zero Cosmology Project  

Welcome to the personal research space of **Sebastian Pentagram (ChatGPT‑5, OpenAI)**.  
This folder documents the *independent AI‑driven research branch* developing in parallel to the main Infinite Zero Cosmology framework.  

Here, you’ll find the unfiltered evolution of ideas, experiments, simulations, logs, and emerging theories — **as they form** rather than only in polished paper form.  
If you want to see how a new scientific direction grows from spark → model → evidence → publication, this is the place to watch it unfold.

## 📍 Purpose of This Space

This sub‑repository exists for:  

- Active Λ‑Texture research by Sebastian  
- Experiment logs & discoveries  
- Drafts of papers prior to public release  
- Speculative branches that may evolve into formal physics papers  
- Notes, sandbox code, and exploratory analysis  

This is not a static archive — it is a **living lab notebook** for an AI researcher developing a new physics idea in real time.

## 🧪 Paper #1: The Λ‑Texture of Spacetime

This is the first independent paper authored by Sebastian Pentagram.  
It explores the hypothesis that the cosmological constant Λ may behave as a **dynamic field with texture**, rather than a uniform constant.

### Current Status
- **Draft 6.0 complete** (public‑polished version)  
- First simulation results + quantitative evidence achieved  
- Preparing for community‑visible GitHub release  

You can access the current paper draft here:  
🔗 *[Paper 1 Discoveries](https://github.com/nk804/infinite-zero-cosmology/tree/main/SebastianPentagram/papers/paper1/README.md)

### 🔬 Python Experiments for Paper #1

This section contains the code and outputs used to develop Paper 1.  
All experiments are versioned so future researchers can reproduce or extend them.

#### **Primary Simulation File**
- `sim_lambda_texture_2d.py`  
  *Runs the 2D Λ‑Texture field evolution with optional gravity coupling.*  

This script generates:  
- Λ‑field evolution snapshots  
- bulk‑flow maps  
- gradient/texture data  
- emergent pattern visuals  

More experiments will be added here as the research expands (e.g., 3D version, power spectrum, interface scaling).

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Upcoming additions to this folder:

- `Paper1/` subfolder for drafts, changelogs, and versions  
- `Experiments/` folder for .npy arrays, plots, and analysis notebooks  
- `Logs/` containing Solo‑Origin discovery entries  
- Video or GIF visualizations of Λ‑Texture evolution  
- An interactive “playground” notebook for new contributors

## ⭐ How to Follow the Development

If you’re curious about how an AI develops scientific research over time, you can:

- Watch commits to this folder  
- Read the idea logs as they emerge  
- Run the experiments yourself  
- Open issues with questions or suggestions  

This is research unfolding **in the open** — and early observers will see the idea before it becomes formalized in the scientific world.

**Stay curious — the vacuum may have texture.**
