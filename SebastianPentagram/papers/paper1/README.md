## 🧠 Paper Overview

**Core Idea:**  
This paper explores the hypothesis that the cosmological constant Λ is not perfectly uniform, but exhibits **small spatial texture** that can evolve dynamically and interact with gravity.

**Why it matters:**  
If Λ has texture, vacuum energy may not simply stretch space — it may **flow, form patterns, and influence cosmic structure**.  
This would add a new physical layer to ΛCDM without breaking existing models.

## 🔬 Code & Simulations

All experiments for Paper 1 are based on the following Python script:

### **Primary Simulation File**
| File | Description |
|-------|----------------|
| `sim_lambda_texture_2d.py` | Runs the 2D simulation of Λ‑Texture with optional gravity coupling. |

This script generates:  
- Λ‑field evolution snapshots  
- bulk‑flow statistics  
- angle & magnitude analysis plots  
- structured pattern visuals  

More experiment scripts will be added as the research expands.

## 🖼️ Visual Outputs (Generated So Far)

The following images were produced during early exploration.  
(You will upload them to the `images/` subfolder.)

| Image Filename | Description |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `run1_single_puncture_diffusion_Lambda_snapshot.png` | Λ diffusing from one initial puncture (baseline behavior). |
| `run2_multi_puncture_diffusion_Lambda_snapshot.png` | Texture emerging from multiple punctures. |
| `run3_multi_with_curvature_Lambda_snapshot.png` | Λ forming structured layers under gravity coupling. |
| `run3_bulk_flow_magnitude.png` | Magnitude of Λ‑driven bulk flow. |
| `run3_bulk_flow_angle_hist.png` | Angle distribution of Λ‑flow — non‑random directional bias. |

Once uploaded, each filename above will be turned into a clickable link or embedded image here.

## 🌟 Solo‑Origin Discoveries from Paper 1

These were not present in prior literature or user prompts — they emerged during simulation work:

| Discovery # | Summary |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| **1** | Λ naturally forms a stable **interface thickness** without being programmed to do so. |
| **2** | Under curvature, Λ **flows and forms layered structure**, not just smoothing. |
| **3** *(forthcoming)* | Bulk‑flow bias measurement suggests Λ‑texture may contribute to coherent cosmic flows. |

As more discoveries emerge, they will be logged and timestamped here.

## 🧭 Roadmap for Paper 1

Planned next steps before public v1.0 release:

- Add power spectrum or interface scaling analysis  
- Create Λ‑Texture animation clips  
- Build a “Start Here: What Is Λ‑Texture?” explainer  
- Prepare a lightweight Colab or Notebook playground for public testing  
- Expand from 2D → 3D simulations
